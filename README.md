Instructions:

1) Open up two instances of the program by double clicking on the jar file (the jar file is an executable).

2) On one window, server mode is automatically selected. Configure host and port as needed as well as change shared secret value to desired value.

3) One the second window, click on client button to switch to client mode. Configure host, port and shared secret value to reflect the server.

4) Click start on the server first, because the client needs a server to connect to.

5) Once the server has started and is waiting for the client, click start on the client. If the host and port are the same, a connection should be established and authentication will begin.

6) The program is set to move step by step in accordance to the continue button. Click on the continue button on the client to go through the steps until it says it is waiting for server response. 

7) Click on continue on the server until it says communication is established.

8) Click on continue on the client until it says communication is established.

9) You can now type into the “Data to be sent” fields on either window. To send the message, click on send.
